<h1>Witchcraft</h1>
<br><br>
<p>
  Here I will be talking about <em>Witchcraft.</em> Why you ask? Because I am currently writing a book about such a topic and I could really
use some <strong>inspiration.</strong> Also because I really need to learn how to code so I hope this will help.</p>
<h3>So, how do I plan on learning how to code?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Keeping at this Codecademy thing.</li> 
  <li>Adding things to this website at least once every few days.</li>
  <li>Doing my very best not to get bored and give up.</li>
  <li>Thinking about how much this will help me in the future.</li>
  <li>Trying to have some fun with it.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Wish me luck!</h1>
